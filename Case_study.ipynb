    "### Real world Case study\n",

    "Scenario: A botanist is trying to figure out if both types of iris blooms have different sepal length variability. The variation in sepal lengths across plants can reveal variations in genetic diversity, environmental adaption, or measurement stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dateset \n",
    "Downloaded and used the iris.csv dataset. it contains sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species for 150 flowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Null hypothesis (H₀): Variances of sepal length in Setosa and Versicolor are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis (Hₐ): Variances of sepal length in Setosa and Versicolor are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "The F-test was applied by computing the ratio of the larger variance to the smaller variance.\n",
    "A two-tailed p-value was calculated to determine whether the observed variance ratio could occur by chance or under normal circumstance(null hypothesis)"
